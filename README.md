# Recipe Scaler

This is a Python script that allows you to scale a recipe based on the desired serving size. Simply input the original recipe ingredients and quantities, as well as the desired serving size, and the script will output the scaled recipe.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `recipe_scaler.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `recipe_scaler.py` file.
3. Run the script by typing `python recipe_scaler.py` and pressing Enter.
4. Follow the prompts to input the original recipe ingredients and quantities, as well as the desired serving size.
5. The script will output the scaled recipe.

## Example

Suppose you have a recipe for chicken teriyaki that serves 4 people, but you want to scale it up to serve 10 people. Here's how you can use the Recipe Scaler script to do that:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `recipe_scaler.py` file.
2. Run the script by typing `python recipe_scaler.py` and pressing Enter.
3. Follow the prompts to input the original recipe ingredients and quantities, as well as the desired serving size:
   ```
   Enter ingredient name (or 'done' to finish): Chicken
   Enter quantity: 2
   Enter unit of measurement (e.g. cups, grams, ounces, whole count): pounds
   Enter ingredient name (or 'done' to finish): Soy Sauce
   Enter quantity: 10
   Enter unit of measurement (e.g. cups, grams, ounces, whole count): cups
   Enter ingredient name (or 'done' to finish): done
   Enter desired serving size: 10
   ```
4. The script will output the scaled recipe:
   ```
   Scaled Recipe:
   Chicken: 20.00 pounds
   Soy Sauce: 100.00 cups
   ```
5. Use the scaled recipe to cook chicken teriyaki for 10 people! (Note: This is not the full recipe for Chicken Teriyaki, I am sorry...)

This example shows how you can use the Recipe Scaler script to easily scale a recipe to serve more people.
